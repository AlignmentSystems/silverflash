This project is a reference implementation of FIXP Performance Session Layer. It is intended to 
aid developers of financial and other critical applications. Since the protocol stack is 
standardized, it serves to exchange messages between organizations while keeping low latency
characteristics.

## Protocol stack
FIX Performance Session Layer (FIXP) is a lightweight protocol designed to replace the traditional
FIX session protocol (known officially as FIXT) for high performance use cases. It supports both 
point-to-point exchange of application messages as well as multicasts for market data and the like.

FIXP is part of a family of protocols created by the High Performance Working Group
of the FIX Trading Community. FIXP is a session layer protocol (OSI layer 5). 
See specifications at [FIXTradingCommunity/fixp-specification](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fixp-specification). *This implementation is intended to ease development but it is non-normative for the FIXP protocol. The specification is the ultimate authority.*

At presentation layer (layer 6), this implementation uses Simple Binary Encoding, a high-performance binary encoding of FIX. 
See specifications at [FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-simple-binary-encoding).

At transport layer (layer 4), this project provides wrappers for common transports, including TCP 
and UDP, as well as interprocess communications for internal messaging.
